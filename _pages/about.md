I am young researcher with master's degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering (CSE Applied Mechanics) and background of Mechanical Engineering. With expertise in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), High-Performance Computing (HPC), and data-driven modeling. Currently, working as CFD Support Engineer, contributing to R&D and technical consultation for Industries and Academics. My Research Interest lies in developing efficient, scalable modelling strategies along with Artificial Intelligence.

I have been actively been a part of CFD Group at Computational Aeronautics Lab (CAL, SINES) and Supercomputing Lab (SCL, SINES). My work includes exploring surrogate models as an alternative of CFD for flow field prediction, enabling rapid design exploration and physically consistent predictions.

Currently, exploring Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and neural operators such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) and Convolutional Neural Operators (CNOs) as next-generation CFD surrogates, which are actively used by researchers for developing hybrid frameworks that accelerate simulations, improve predictive accuracy, and support sustainable engineering design. I am also actively seeking PhD opportunity where I can further pursue research at the intersection of CFD, machine learning, and high-performance computing.
