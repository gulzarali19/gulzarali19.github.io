I am a researcher with a Master’s degree in Computational Sciences and Engineering, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and machine learning. My academic background in mechanical engineering, with a focus on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and CFD, has led me to explore advanced techniques in numerical modeling of multiphysics problems and equip me with expertise of utilizing power of high-performance computing (HPC).

My research integrates CFD with machine learning to predict and optimize temperature hotspots in data centers, improving cooling efficiency and energy consumption. I am also involved in data-driven approaches for turbulence modeling, utilizing NNs and PINNs to enhance simulation accuracy and speed.

In addition, I work extensively on multiphase flow simulations, modeling complex interactions in flow regimes using tools such as ANSYS Fluent and COMSOL. My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional numerical methods and artificial intelligence to solve real-world engineering problems more efficiently.

I am passionate about applying cutting-edge AI techniques to fluid dynamics and thermal management systems, pushing the boundaries of research in data-driven modeling, multiphase flows, and HPC-driven simulations.
